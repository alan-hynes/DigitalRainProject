# A Modern C++ Digital Rain Project

## Introduction

This is my Digital Rain Project! This project is a modern C++ implementation of the "digital rain" effect popularised by film The Matrix. The application creates a variety of characters falling down the terminal screen, with customisable features like color schemes, character sets, and animation density.

In this blog, I will document my journey developing this project, focusing on software design, algorithm development, problem-solving approaches, and modern C++ insights. I will share key code snippets and design decisions that showcase my understanding of C++ programming principles.
